## Project description
TiltBot is an entertainment device where you try to get a ball from one side of a maze to the opposite side, just by tilting it. Along the way, you'll need to dodge holes, or you'll have to start over!
Using it is simple: you can tilt the maze platform where the ball is located with a joystick.

If crossing the maze is too difficult, TiltBot has an extra feature. You can switch to an automatic mode, where AI will solve the maze, showing you one of the possible paths to the end. (For now, the algorithm is somewhat limited. See the Limitations section.)

Additionally, to increase the amount of fun, the maze format can be customized. You can open or close holes, as well as restructure the walls to choose your own difficulty.

## Structure
The structure is one of the most important parts of this project.

#### Laberinth platform

#### Walls and plugs

####  


## Arquitecture
For the operation of TiltBot, we have divided its components into two interconnected modules.

### Action Module
This module is the one in charged of the actual movement of the laberinth that allows the puzzle to be solved.

#### Action Hardware
In order to move the structure, we make use of two different servo motors, one for the outer layer, and the other for the inner layer. Each of this servos move in different directions, allowing the structure to tilt in any angle needed. For a deeper understanding check [Structure](#Structure).

To be able to control manually this servos we have also connected a joystick, which moves both motors acordingly to the direction and amount of preassure applied on it.

All of this is interconected by an Arduino R3 module.
